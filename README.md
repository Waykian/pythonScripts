# pythonScripts
A few Python scripts to keep track of what I learn.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/theWacian/pythonScripts.git
```
2. Change the working directory to pythonScripts
```
$ cd pythonScripts
```
Each one of the subdirectories contains scripts independent from each other, so

3. Change the working directory to the directory of the script you want to use
```
cd scriptDirectory
```
4. Install the requirements
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
